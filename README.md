This repository contains all scripts to reproduce the results of the manuscript.

#### Highlights
* A multi-omics resource of naïve and capacitated human pluripotent stem cells.
* Chemical resetting of conventional hPSCs re-establishes X chromosome inactivation and rescues epigenetic X chromosome erosion.
* Transcriptional signatures of capacitated cells have a reduced ectoderm-biased compared to conventional hPSCs.
* Naïve pluripotency genes have promoters mostly enriched with H3K27ac marks.

  
#### Abstract
<p align="justify"> 
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are of fundamental relevance in regenerative medicine and the primary source for many novel cellular therapies. The development of naïve culture conditions has led to the expectation that these naïve hPCS could overcome many of the limitations found in standard (primed) hPSCs culture conditions, including recurrent epigenetic anomalies. Recent work has shown that only after capacitation naïve hPSCs acquire multi-lineage differentiation competence, suggesting that the transition from naïve to primed hPSCs may recapitulate essential and specific features of human pre-implantation biology. Here we now studied the epigenetic dynamics found during the transition between naïve and primed pluripotency, looking at global genomic redistribution of histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, and DNA methylation, and correlating these with gene expression. Our results reveal that hPSC resetting and subsequent capacitation rescues X chromosome linked epigenetic erosion, reduces the ectoderm-biased gene expression of conventional primed hPSCs, and identifies retrotransposons, enhancers, and CpG islands as hotspots of epigenetic dynamics between pluripotency states.
